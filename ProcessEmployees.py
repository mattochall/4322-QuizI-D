has decided to reward them with a 10% increase in their salary. To evaluate the impact on the budget, you have been
asked to run a report on the employee file and display the results of BEFORE AND AFTER the salary increase.

You will create a dictionary that has the full employee name as the key and ONLY their new salary as the value.

Iternate through the dictionary to print out their name and thier new salary (as in image)
